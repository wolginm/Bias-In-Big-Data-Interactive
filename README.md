# Educational Interactive: Bias in Big Data

This project holds Unity development code for an educational interactive demonstrating bias in data selection in Big Data for the course Educational Game Development (CISC374) at the University of Delaware. The objective of this interactive is to show how small changes in selection and perception can change the result of a study or competition. The user will learn how to better view data by altering their perspective.

## Built With

- Unity

## Known Bugs
- The dots in the first stage of the interactive do not always show that they are “selected” on the first try. The user may need to click the very center of the dot for it to register as “selected.”
- Some dots may show up partially or completely off screen making it hard or even impossible for the user to select them

## Future Features
Our potential future features are aimed to add complexity to the interactive. For example, we can an additional stage that involves zooming out of a scene to reveal hidden circles. This idea was suggested by our clients from the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand during our beta release client meeting. The stages can be added if the average amount of time it took for the users to complete the current version of our interactive is too short. According to the beta release feedback from our clients, however, the current version was short enough to hold users’ attention and successfully address the learning outcome.
